Images in this directory were used by SC29WG1 for the purpose of subjective
and objective image quality evaluation.

Images in this directory are subsets of the images from other test sets,
mostly from the Microsoft HDPhoto test set ("hdcompare") and the Honolulu
Test set by Olivier Pfeiffer. Please see the corresponding directories for
the licence conditions.

This directory originally also included four additional images for which
SC29WG1 does not hold sufficient rights to release them. An image of a 
painting kindfully provided for JPEG internal use by the London Gallery,
and three well-known images ("bike", "cafe" and "woman") originally stemming
from the JPEG-LS test image set. Unfortunately, formal attributes of these
images are unknown at this time, and hence they are currently only available
for JPEG internal testing.
